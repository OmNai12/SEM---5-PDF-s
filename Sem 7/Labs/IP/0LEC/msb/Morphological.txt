Erosion (A - B)
- place the structuring element over the image, if all the ones in the 
se match with the image then put a 1 in the centre else put a 0.
-shrinks the one
Eg: 
	0 0 0 0 0			0 0 0 0 0
	0 1 1 1 0   	0 1 0		0 0 0 0 0
	0 1 1 1 0	1 1 1		0 0 1 0 0
	0 1 1 1 0	0 1 0		0 0 0 0 0
	0 0 0 0 0			0 0 0 0 0
	Image 		SE		Eroded Image


Dilation (A + B)
- Place the structuring element over the image, if atleast one matches
replace the centre with 1.
-Expands the image

0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0

Opening: Erosion followed by dilation(OED)
Removes small borders and smoothen the boundaries

Closing: Dilation followed by erosion (ODC)
fills small opening, connects disconnected objects

Boundary Extraction: Process of extracting the boundary
A - (A errosion B)

Region Filling
SE always:	0 1 0
		1 1 1		4 connecting structuring element
		0 1 0
X0 = A
X1 = (X0 dilation B) intersection A compliment

Connected Components:
SE: either 8 or 4 connecting structuring element
X0 = A
X1 = (X0 dilation B) intersection A  

Hit and Miss Transform
- extract pixels with specific neighbourhood

Convex Hull: Polygon created using connecting all 1s.
